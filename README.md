# SENG8091 Assignment 1 - Getting Organized: Pet Daycare Client Meeting Preparation Document

## Executive Summary
This document will summarize how I am going to prepare for the first client meeting with a Pet Daycare business. Based on early findings mentioned in the instruction, there are three main issues we will need to address:

- New employee onboarding is taking more than three months
- Client onboarding is inconsistent between employees
- Customers find the onboarding process confusing
  
My goal is to come prepared with questions, assumptions and also plan early so that we can maximize and make the most of our limited time with the client and start off on the right foot.

## 1. Assumptions & Validation Plan

### Assumptions About the Business
1. **The daycare opens only on weekdays and roughly 7 AM to 7 PM**
   I will confirm this in the meeting
2. **They probably have about 5 to 15 staff**
   I will confirm this from the manager
3. **I estimate their active customers to be around 50 to 200.**
   I will request actual client data or their projections
4. **Their onboarding process for both employee and client is done manually or with paper**
   I will observe this since it's a physical meeting or ask for examples.

### Assumptions About Tech and Tools
5. **They don't use many digital tools. I would guess maybe just internet and spreadsheets.**
   I will ask about their current setup
6. **Their staff may not be tech savy but may be familiar with basic computer use**
   I will get a sense of this from talking to them
7. **The daycares' budget might be tight. So, they will need a phased and affordable solution**
   I will ask what is realistic for them in terms of cost 
   

## 2. Requirements Breakdown

### What the System Needs to Do (Functional Requirements)
#### For the Owners (My Client)
- Dashboard to view onboarding progress for both staff and clients
- Manage employee roles, permissions, and training progress
- Edit Onboarding workflows and form templates
- Access to reports
- Export data for compliance or audit purposes

#### For Employees
- Create a standard training module accessible via their website
- Track onboarding progress
- Confirm employees are ready before they start working alone
- Make sure access is based on roles
- Store all key documents in one place

#### For Pet Owners (Customers)
- Let them register online through a user-friendly portal
- Let them fill out required forms e.g. vaccination records
- Allow them to create pet profiles (with medical or emergency information)
- Handle service agreements and payment setup
- Automate basic approvals and progress tracking
- They should be able to communicate with staffs if needed

### System Qualities (Non-Functional)
- Easy to use for everyone
- Data is securely stored
- Works on phones and tablets
- Secure, especially for personal info
- Can grow as the business grows

## 3. Questions I Plan to Ask

### About What They Do Now
- Can you brief me on how you onboard new employees?
- From start to finish, what are the steps a customer go through to sign up their pet?
- Where do you notice delays or confusion?
- Do different staff members go about onboarding or attending to customers in different ways?

### About What They Want
- What would an ideal onboarding process look like?
- How would you know if the new system is working well?
- What would make life easier for your staff and clients?

### About Their Tech Infrastructure
- What tools or software (e.g ERP, CRM) are you using right now?
- How do you handle payments?
- Would you need this solution to connect to other systems like billing or scheduling?
- Do you have data we would need to move to a new system?


## 4. Follow-Up Clarification Questions
- What works well with your current onboarding system?
- Can you share specific customer feedback?
- Does onboarding time impact staff retention?
- Who will use what parts of the system?
- What are your constraints around training and rollout?

## 5. Tasks to Kick Off the Project

### Step 1: Learn and Analyze
- Interview stakeholders
- Watch current onboarding sessions
- Write down current workflows
- Collect any documents or checklists they use
- Identify different user roles (staff, clients)
- Define what success looks like

### Step 2: Plan the System
- Write clear requirements
- Sketch out sample screens or workflows
- Draft a list of features needed
- Decide how users will log in and what they’ll see

### Step 3: Prepare for Development
- Set up dev tools and testing plans
- Outline phases of development (sprints)
- Plan training and rollout

## 7. What Success Looks Like

### Numbers We Can Measure
- Reduce employee onboarding time to half
- Make it easy for customer onboarding and consistent with it for at least 90% of the time
- Fewer onboarding related errors or issues. Target should be around a 75% drop
- More satisfied customers (we can evaluate this through surveys or feedback)

### Other Signs We’re On Track
- Staff feel more confident with new process
- Customers say it’s easier to get started
- Managers can track progress easily
