# SENG8091 Assignment 1 - Getting Organized: Pet Daycare Client Meeting Preparation Document

## Executive Summary
This document will summarize how I am going to prepare for the first client meeting with a Pet Daycare business. Based on early findings mentioned in the instruction, there are three main issues we will need to address:

- New employee onboarding is taking more than three months
- Client onboarding is inconsistent between employees
- Customers find the onboarding process confusing
  
My goal is to come prepared with questions, assumptions and also plan early so that we can maximize and make the most of our limited time with the client and start off on the right foot.
