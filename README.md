# SENG8091 Assignment 1 - Getting Organized: Pet Daycare Client Meeting Preparation Document

## Executive Summary
This document will summarize how I am going to prepare for the first client meeting with a Pet Daycare business. Based on early findings mentioned in the instruction, there are three main issues we will need to address:

- New employee onboarding is taking more than three months
- Client onboarding is inconsistent between employees
- Customers find the onboarding process confusing
  
My goal is to come prepared with questions, assumptions and also plan early so that we can maximize and make the most of our limited time with the client and start off on the right foot.

## 1. Assumptions & Validation Plan

### Assumptions About the Business
1. **The daycare opens only on weekdays and roughly 7 AM to 7 PM**
   I will confirm this in the meeting
2. **They probably have about 5 to 15 staffs**
   I will confirm this from the manager
3. **I estimate their active customers to be around 50 to 200.**
   I will request actual client data or their projections
4. **Their onboarding process for both employee and client is done manually or with paper**
   I will observe this since it's a physical meeting or ask for examples.

### Assumptions About Tech and Tools
5. **They don't use many digital tools. I would guess maybe just internet and spreadsheets.**
   I will ask about their current setup
6. **Their staff may not be tech savy but may be familiar with basic computer use**
   I will get a sense of this from talking to them
7. **The daycares' budget might be tight. So, they will need a phased and affordable solution**
   I will ask what is realistic for them in terms of cost
